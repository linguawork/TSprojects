# miniProjectsTS
Every folder in this repo contains a project in Typescript.
(Initially I thought to push a project into every branch of the repo, but decided to place them just into folders and make a descriptive README. This way it is simpler.)

Pre-project 1:
The main idea here is to introduce basic commands to start a small TS project.
All the commands are written in a txt file. 

Pre-project 2:
The main idea of the project to introduce other commands that can help to create a more complex project including JS libraries. 
Here Snowpack bundle is used. All the commands are written in a txt file. 

Project 1: 
A simple to-do list. The main purpose is to get used to coding in TS style after JS. 



P.S:
npm start in the folder of the project, not outside. 
When the page opens go to the directory: http://localhost:5500/*/

when pushing, go out to the main directory
