# Typescript Projects Repository

Every folder in this repository contains a standalone project written in TypeScript. Initially, I planned to use separate branches for each project but opted to organize them into folders instead, with a descriptive README for simplicity.

## Contents

- [Pre-Project 1: Basic Commands for a TypeScript Project](#pre-project-1-basic-commands-for-a-typescript-project)
- [Pre-Project 2: Introducing More Complex Commands and Snowpack](#pre-project-2-introducing-more-complex-commands-and-snowpack)

## Pre-Project 1: Basic Commands for a TypeScript Project

This pre-project introduces the basic commands needed to start a small TypeScript project. All commands are documented in a text file within the folder.

### Running the Project
- **Run the project**: Use `npm start` **inside the project folder**.
- **Access the project**: Once started, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5500/](http://localhost:5500/) to view the project.

## Pre-Project 2: Introducing More Complex Commands and Snowpack

This pre-project introduces additional commands and the use of Snowpack to manage JavaScript libraries, enabling more complex project structures. Commands are documented in a text file within the folder.

### Snowpack Setup
To create a Snowpack project, use the following commands:

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app . --template @snowpack/app-template-blank-typescript --force
