# Project 2: one more ToDOList
This project is created a little differently from the previous one. It is run in the folder: Project 2
A different approach but still the same practice in TS.


## Installation scripts:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
#select Vanilla and then select Typescript
#when you create you name the project and it will create a project folder within your folder

cd /projectFolder

npm i 
#or npm install

npm run dev
# inside the project folder which was created
```
The project will run on local host: http://localhost:5173/ \
You will see Vite and TS logo with a counter
